# STM32F3-TFT2.4-Touchscreen

Hello Humans,

This is my first request, I am an Electrical Engineering student who was working on a Reflow-Oven controller as a part of my internship. During my Internship I was asked to write codes for the Screen Initialization, Touch Screen Initialization,Menu Controller and graphing function.
 
The main goal of this project was to allow the user to set a constant temperature, if desired,through the touchscreen or to set a parameter of values such as;
- Ramp up [C/s]
- Soak Temperautre [C]
- Soak Time [s]
- Peak Temperature [C]
- Peak Time [C]


In the following request you will find codes for the STM32F3Discovery board & ER-TFTM024-3;
- Screen Initialization
- Touch Screen Initialization
- Menu Controller
- Graphing Functions


Note that: The menu controller function does not work properly, I still havent been able to fix the problem.

Problem: Once the user touches the menu button, then the user goes to the next menu but if the user presses on the same stop where the previous menu button was then the screen keeps refreshing.

Another important note is that I cant provide other parts of the code due to copyright, I solely provide the parts that I have mentioned above
